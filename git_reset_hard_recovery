# Recovering from a git reset --hard

1. Check the reflog, reset the head to where you want it

	git reflog
	git reset HEAD@{<A commit number goes here>}

will bring you back to the state where you accidentally deleted your files. Running git status, you should see your files you're trying to recover with "deleted:" next to them. 

2. For each of the deleted files, do:

	git add <deleted file to add back>
	git commit -m "deleted file" <deleted file>
	
3. After adding and commiting all the deleted files, do:

	git log --diff-filter=D --summary

4. Find the large commit hash above each deleted file and run

	git checkout <long disgusting commit hash>^1 <original file name>

which will add back the file to your working (local) directory!
